    On 3 November 2017 there will be a GRASS GIS crash course, organized by OSGeo.nl and the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation of ITC.  The course will provide participants with an overview of the software capabilities and a hands-on experience in raster, vector and time series processing with the Open Source software GRASS GIS 7. For more information, go to <a class="linkified" href="https://osgeo.nl/grassgis-course/">https://osgeo.nl/grassgis-course/</a>. You can register on our Meetup page [update: maximum number of participants has been reached, registration closed].

#### <span style="color: #333333;"><b>Course structure/contents</b></span>

The course consists of mainly practical sessions with a short intro to basic concepts at the beginning. All the code and material will be publicly available**.**

  * We will cover the following introductory topics, among others:
  * GRASS database, locations and mapsets
  * Working with different data types (vector, raster, 3D raster formats, time series)
  * Different interfaces (GUI, CLI, Python)
  * Region and mask
  * Scripting examples
  * Visualization of spatial data; scale bar, symbols, grids, color tables, histograms
  * Where to find help

After the introduction with simple examples, we will go together through a guided exercise to demonstrate a full workflow in GRASS GIS, involving raster, vector and temporal data. In the end, participants will have the chance to follow three different tutorials: Remote sensing analysis using satellite data, Time series processing and spatial point interpolation. Teachers will be available for questions and explanations.

  * Friday, November 3rd, 2017 from 10.30 to 16.30 (with 1-hour for lunch break)
  * ITC – Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation. University of Twente. Hengelosestraat 99, 7514 AE, Enschede. The Netherlands.
