This is the https://osgeo.nl website. 
This site was migrated from Wordpress to Hugo in GitHub in 2022. 
Some glitches still present!

## Migration from WP
Links

* https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/#wordpress
* https://ma.ttias.be/step-by-step-guide-migrating-wordpress-to-hugo/

Followed latter steps:

* backup WP and MySQL 
* install the SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter plugin. 
* https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter/releases v2.0.1 
* Go to your WordPress, Plugins > Add New
* Pick Upload Plugin and choose the ZIP file you just downloaded
* Activate the plugin after installation
* Once the plugin is installed, you can try to go to Tools > Export to Hugo. That page might take a while to load.
  

Using the [Hugo Clarity Theme](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity).

Added GitHub Workflows, hosting on GitHub. 

Now maintaining the site is a breeze!
